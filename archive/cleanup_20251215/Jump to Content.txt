Get Started For Programmers
Welcome to the Lighter SDK and API Introduction. Here, we will go through everything from the system setup, to creating and cancelling all types of orders, to fetching exchange data.

Setting up an API KEY
In order to get started using the Lighter API, you must first set up an API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY, as you will need it to sign any transaction you want to make. You can find how to do it in the following example. The BASE_URL will reflect if your key is generated on testnet or mainnet (for mainnet, just change the BASE_URL in the example to https://mainnet.zklighter.elliot.ai). Note that you also need to provide your ETH_PRIVATE_KEY.

You can setup up to 253 API keys (2 <= API_KEY_INDEX <= 254). The 0 index is the one reserved for the desktop, while 1 is the one reserved for the mobile. Finally, the 255 index can be used as a value for the api_key_index parameter of the apikeys method of the AccountApi for getting the data about all the API keys.

In case you do not know your ACCOUNT_INDEX, you can find it by querying the AccountApi for the data about your account, as shown in this example.

Account types
Lighter API users can operate under a Standard or Premium accounts. The Standard account is fee-less. Premium accounts pay 0.2 bps maker and 2 bps taker fees. Find out more in Account Types.

The Signer
In order to create a transaction (create/cancel/modify order), you need to use the SignerClient. Initialize with the following code:

Initialize SignerClient

 client = lighter.SignerClient(  
        url=BASE_URL,  
        private_key=API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY,  
        account_index=ACCOUNT_INDEX,  
        api_key_index=API_KEY_INDEX  
    )
The code for the signer can be found in the same repo, in the signer_client.py file. You may notice that it uses a binary for the signer: the code for it can be found in the lighter-go public repo, and you can compile it yourself using the justfile.

Nonce
When signing a transaction, you may need to provide a nonce (number used once). A nonce needs to be incremented each time you sign something. You can get the next nonce that you need to use using the TransactionApi’s next_nonce method or take care of incrementing it yourself. Note that each nonce is handled per API_KEY.

Signing a transaction
One can sign a transaction using the SignerClient’s sign_create_order, sign_modify_order, sign_cancel_order and its other similar methods. For actually pushing the transaction, you need to call send_tx or send_tx_batch using the TransactionApi. Here’s an example that includes such an operation.

Note that base_amount, price are to be passed as integers, and client_order_index is an unique (across all markets) identifier you provide for you to be able to reference this order later (e.g. if you want to cancel it).

The following values can be provided for the order_type parameter:

ORDER_TYPE_LIMIT
ORDER_TYPE_MARKET
ORDER_TYPE_STOP_LOSS
ORDER_TYPE_STOP_LOSS_LIMIT
ORDER_TYPE_TAKE_PROFIT
ORDER_TYPE_TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT
ORDER_TYPE_TWAP
The following values can be provided for the time_in_force parameter:

ORDER_TIME_IN_FORCE_IMMEDIATE_OR_CANCEL
ORDER_TIME_IN_FORCE_GOOD_TILL_TIME
ORDER_TIME_IN_FORCE_POST_ONLY
Signer Client Useful Wrapper Functions
The SignerClient provides several functions that sign and push a type of transaction. Here’s a list of some of them:

create_order - signs and pushes a create order transaction;
create_market_order - signs and pushes a create order transaction for a market order;
create_cancel_order - signs and pushes a cancel transaction for a certain order. Note that the order_index needs to equal the client_order_index of the order to cancel;
cancel_all_orders - signs and pushes a cancel all transactions. Note that, depending on the time_in_force provided, the transaction has different consequences:
ORDER_TIME_IN_FORCE_IMMEDIATE_OR_CANCEL - ImmediateCancelAll;
ORDER_TIME_IN_FORCE_GOOD_TILL_TIME - ScheduledCancelAll;
ORDER_TIME_IN_FORCE_POST_ONLY - AbortScheduledCancelAll.
create_auth_token_with_expiry - creates an auth token (useful for getting data using the Api and Ws methods)
API
The SDK provides API classes that make calling the Lighter API easier. Here are some of them and the most important of their methods:

AccountApi - provides account data
account - get account data either by l1_address or index
accounts_by_l1_address - get data about all the accounts (master account and subaccounts)
apikeys - get data about the api keys of an account (use api_key_index = 255 for getting data about all the api keys)
TransactionApi - provides transaction related data
next_nonce - get next nonce to be used for signing a transaction using a certain api key
send_tx - push a transaction
send_tx_batch - push several transactions at once
OrderApi - provides data about orders, trades and the orderbook
order_book_details - get data about a specific market’s orderbook
order_books - get data about all markets’ orderbooks
You can find the rest here. We also provide an example showing how to use some of these. For the methods that require an auth token, you can generate one using the create_auth_token_with_expiry method of the SignerClient (the same applies to the websockets auth).

WebSockets
Lighter also provides access to essential info using websockets. A simple version of an WsClient for subscribing to account and orderbook updates is implemented here. You can also take it as an example implementation of such a client.

To get access to more data, you will need to connect to the websockets without the provided WsClient. You can find the streams you can connect to, how to connect, and the data they provide in the websockets section.

Account Index
The account index is how Lighter identifies the wallets using integer numbers.

You can learn your account index by querying accountsByL1Address endpoint.

The response has sub_accounts as a list. The first element of the list is your main account and the index of the main account is your account index.

Account Types
Lighter API users can operate under a Standard or Premium account.

Premium Account (Opt-in) -- Suitable for HFT, the lowest latency on Lighter.
Fees: 0.002% Maker, 0.02% Taker
maker/cancel latency: 0ms
taker latency: 150ms
part of volume quota program

Standard Account (Default) -- Suitable for retail and latency insensitive traders.
fees: 0 maker / 0 taker
taker latency: 300ms
maker: 200ms
cancel order: 100ms

Account Switch
You can change your Account Type (tied to your L1 address) using the /changeAccountTier endpoint.

You may call that endpoint if:

You have no open positions
You have no open orders
At least 24 hours have passed since the last call
Python snippet to switch tiers:

Python: switch to premium
Python: switch to standard

import asyncio
import logging
import lighter
import requests

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

BASE_URL = "https://mainnet.zklighter.elliot.ai"

# You can get the values from the system_setup.py script
# API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY =
# ACCOUNT_INDEX =
# API_KEY_INDEX =


async def main():
    client = lighter.SignerClient(
        url=BASE_URL,
        private_key=API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY,
        account_index=ACCOUNT_INDEX,
        api_key_index=API_KEY_INDEX,
    )

    err = client.check_client()
    if err is not None:
        print(f"CheckClient error: {err}")
        return

    auth, err = client.create_auth_token_with_expiry(
        lighter.SignerClient.DEFAULT_10_MIN_AUTH_EXPIRY
    )

    response = requests.post(
        f"{BASE_URL}/api/v1/changeAccountTier",
        data={"account_index": ACCOUNT_INDEX, "new_tier": "premium"},
        headers={"Authorization": auth},
    )
    if response.status_code != 200:
        print(f"Error: {response.text}")
        return
    print(response.json())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

How fees are collected:
In isolated margin, fees are taken from the isolated position itself, but if needed, we automatically transfer from cross margin to keep the position healthy. In cross margin, fees are always deducted directly from the available cross balance.

Sub-accounts share the same tier as the main L1 address on the account. You’ll be able to switch to a Premium Account now. Let us know if you have any questions.

Rate Limits
We enforce rate limits on both REST API and WebSocket usage. These limits applies on both IP address and L1 wallet address.

Below is an overview of our rate limiting rules:

📊 REST API Endpoint Limits
The following limits apply to the https://mainnet.zklighter.elliot.ai/ base URL, different limits (listed further below) apply to https://explorer.elliot.ai/.

Premium Account users have limit of 24000 weighted REST API requests per minute window, while Standard Account users 60 per minute.

ThesendTx and sendTxBatch transaction types are the only types of transactions that can increase in quota (see Volume Quota ), which are used to create and modify orders. All other endpoints are have a set limit of tx per minute and do not increase with volume.

Weights per endpoint are the following:

/api/v1/sendTx, /api/v1/sendTxBatch, /api/v1/nextNonce
Per User: 6
/api/v1/publicPools,/api/v1/txFromL1TxHash
Per User: 50
/api/v1/accountInactiveOrders, /api/v1/deposit/latest
Per User: 100
/api/v1/apikeys
Per User: 150
/api/v1/trades, /api/v1/recentTrades
Per User: 1200
Other endpoints not listed above are limited to:

Per User: 300
🌐 Standard Tier Rate Limit
Requests from a single IP address and L1 wallet address are capped at:

60 requests per minute under the Standard Account
📊 Explorer REST API Endpoint Limits
The following limits apply to the https://explorer.elliot.ai/ Base URL.

Standard Users and Premium Users have the same limit of 15 weighted requests per minute window.

Weights per endpoint are the following:

/api/search
Per User: 3
/api/accounts/param/positions, /api/accounts/param/logs
Per User: 2
Other endpoints not listed above are limited to:

Per User: 1
🔌 WebSocket Limits
To prevent resource exhaustion, we enforce the following usage limits per IP:

Connections: 100
Subscriptions per connection: 100
Total Subscriptions: 1000
Max Messages Per Minute: 200
Max Inflight Messages: 50
Unique Accounts: 10
🧾 Transaction Type Limits (per user)
These limits applied for only Standard Accounts.

Transaction Type	Limit
Default	40 requests / minute
L2Withdraw	2 requests / minute
L2UpdateLeverage	1 request / minute
L2CreateSubAccount	2 requests / minute
L2CreatePublicPool	2 requests / minute
L2ChangePubKey	2 requests / 10 seconds
L2Transfer	1 request / minute
⛔ Rate Limit Exceeding Behavior
If you exceed any rate limit:

You will receive an HTTP 429 Too Many Requests error.
For WebSocket connections, excessive messages may result in disconnection.
To avoid this, please ensure your clients are implementing proper backoff and retry strategies.

Volume Quota
Volume Quota gives users higher rate limits on SendTx and SendTxBatchbased on trading volume and is only available to Premium accounts now.

For every 10 USD of trading volume, traders receive an additional transaction limit (i.e. volume quota increases by 1). SendTx and SendTxBatch requests will return a response indicating the remaining quota, e.g. "10780 volume quota remaining.". Every 15 seconds, you get a free SendTx or SendTxBatch which won't consume volume quota (nor remaining quota). Volume quota is shared across all sub-accounts under the same L1 address.

New accounts start at 1K quota, and you can stack at most 5.000.000 TX allowance in your volume quota, which does not expire.

This differs from Rate Limits, which enforce a maximum of 24000 weight per 60 seconds (rolling minute) for premium accounts. You can check the weight of the endpoints, and standard accounts limits here: Rate Limits.

Nonce Management
It’s better to use multiple api keys.

You can use up to 255 different API_KEY_INDEX values. Each index manages its own nonce stream independently, allowing parallel transaction submission.
In general, if a transaction has a non error response, you can increase the nonce manually (nonce will NOT update right away on the server side) - the cases where there is no api error and the transaction fails internally should be very rare

This page will help you get started with zkLighter WebSocket server.

Connection
URL: wss://mainnet.zklighter.elliot.ai/stream; wss://testnet.zklighter.elliot.ai/stream

You can directly connect to the WebSocket server using wscat:


wscat -c 'wss://mainnet.zklighter.elliot.ai/stream'
Send Tx
You can send transactions using the websocket as follows:

JSON

{
    "type": "jsonapi/sendtx",
    "data": {
        "tx_type": INTEGER,
        "tx_info": ...
    }
}
The tx_type options can be found in the SignerClient file, while tx_info can be generated using the sign methods in the SignerClient.

Example: ws_send_tx.py

Send Batch Tx
You can send batch transactions to execute up to 50 transactions in a single message.

JSON

{
    "type": "jsonapi/sendtxbatch",
    "data": {
        "tx_types": "[INTEGER]",
        "tx_infos": "[tx_info]"
    }
}
The tx_type options can be found in the SignerClient file, while tx_info can be generated using the sign methods in the SignerClient.

Example: ws_send_batch_tx.py

Types
We first need to define some types that appear often in the JSONs.

Channels
Order Book
The order book channel sends the new ask and bid orders for the given market. While the nonce is tied to Lighter's matching engine, the offset is tied to the API servers; hence, you can expect the offset to change on reconnection if you're routed to a different server. Additionally, this channel sends a complete snapshot on connection, but only state updates after that.

JSON

{
    "type": "subscribe",
    "channel": "order_book/{MARKET_INDEX}"
}
Example Subscription

JSON

{
    "type": "subscribe",
    "channel": "order_book/0"
