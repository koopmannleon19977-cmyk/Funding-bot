# Vision and Roadmap

### Introduction to Extended

Extended is a perp DEX, built by an ex-Revolut team. As of now, Extended offers perpetual contracts on both crypto and TradFi assets, with USDC as collateral and leverage of up to 100x.

Looking ahead, we are working on a vision to enable open unified margin logic and native integrations into major mobile wallets.

### What sets Extended apart

Extended is building beyond perps, with a unique product vision centered around unified margin. The goal is to create a full-suite trading experience — combining perps, spot, and integrated lending markets under one margin system.

The first phase of this product vision focuses on **integrating a native lending and borrowing market into Extended.** This will allow users to post any supported asset — including yield-bearing ones — as collateral and earn additional yield through the integrated lending layer.

For example, if a user deposits wstETH as collateral and incurs a negative PnL while trading USDC-settled perpetuals, this effectively means borrowing USDC — with interest paid to USDC lenders.

Once the native lending market is in place, we will **add spot markets to Extended's offering** — expanding toward a cross-asset collateral unified margin with integrated perpetuals, lending, and spot trading.

Besides expanding its product offering, Extended is actively working on native integrations with wallets to make perpetuals available directly within wallet interfaces—similar to how swaps are currently integrated. This approach aims to unlock access to a new base of retail users.

### **Longer-term Vision**

Unified margin will initially serve as a core internal product, designed to meet the needs of traders by enabling multi-asset collateral support and delivering one of the most capital-efficient trading systems in the market. However, the long-term vision for Extended goes far beyond that.

Following Hyperliquid’s success, many perpetual DEXs are now following the playbook of launching perps and then building a general-purpose chain — but Extended is taking a different path. We’ll be sharing more details soon, but briefly, the ambition is to build an **EVM-compatible network on top of Starknet, where unified margin logic is embedded directly into the base layer and exposed as an ERC-20 token accessible to all applications on the network**.

<figure><img src="https://3693216602-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FThTVaNuyiBCaumOB7kqP%2Fuploads%2FqHlyizdP9aXKq8yuQRiI%2F43293027-1e1e-4f53-8189-2bb75ab5a256.png?alt=media&#x26;token=0f74af17-69d4-4c8a-8e33-1f4eecc53dc0" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This means that core functions — such as margining with native, network-wide borrowing and lending, and liquidation — will be handled by the network itself rather than by individual applications.

The Extended network, with global unified margin at its core, will allow **all applications within the network to access users’ available margin and share unified liquidity** — reinforcing overall liquidity depth. From the user’s perspective, **all activity will contribute to a single global margin account** shared across applications, allowing them to manage one account instead of multiple app-specific ones and maximize capital efficiency by using the same margin across dApps.

The security and fairness of the network will be ensured by independent validators who execute the core business logic of the unified margin, validate transactions, and handle sequencing. The application state machines run by validators will be open-sourced and optimized for financial applications, with latency under 100 ms.

### Roadmap

We are following a three-step roadmap — evolving from a Perp DEX into a full Open Financial Ecosystem powered by Native Unified Margin.

# Technical Architecture

### Overview of Extended Architecture

Extended operates as a hybrid Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) exchange. While order processing, matching, position risk assessment, and transaction sequencing are handled off-chain, transaction validation and trade settlement occur on-chain via Starknet.

<figure><img src="https://3693216602-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FThTVaNuyiBCaumOB7kqP%2Fuploads%2FbpCzsUqcF1Hhvte7o8T4%2Farchitecture.7f5cc42b.svg?alt=media&#x26;token=13b07f06-b8f7-4eb1-a9d2-73c2fb8933f3" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Extended is designed to operate in a completely trustless manner, enabled by two core principles:

* Users retain self-custody of their funds, with all assets held in smart contracts on Starknet. This means Extended has no custodial access to user assets under any circumstances.
* On-chain validation of the trading logic ensures that fraudulent or incorrect transactions, including liquidations that are contrary to the on-chain rules, are never permitted.

All transactions that happen on Extended are settled on Starknet. While Starknet does not rely on Ethereum Layer 1 for every individual transaction, it inherits Ethereum’s security by publishing zero-knowledge proofs every few hours. These proofs validate state transitions on Starknet, ensuring the integrity and correctness of the entire system.

For a deeper breakdown of the core principles that make Extended trustless, see [our blog post](https://extended.exchange/blog/why-safe).

### Benefits of Extended Hybrid Model

The decision to adopt a hybrid model for Extended is a strategic design choice aiming to overcome the limitations of both fully centralized and decentralized on-chain order book models:

* Challenges with Centralized Exchanges: Traditional centralized exchanges pose risks due to custodial control over user funds, lack of real-time transparency, and susceptibility to trading manipulation.
* Challenges with On-chain Order Books: On-chain order books face issues like the risk of front-running and inherent latency from blockchain transaction validation by multiple parties. Fully decentralized exchanges struggle to match the performance of centralized exchanges, which is crucial for liquidity and reliability.

Extended's hybrid model leverages the strengths of both centralized and decentralized components:

* On-chain Settlement with Validations and Oracle Prices: Extended settles each trade on the blockchain and on-chain validations of trading logic ensure the prevention of fraudulent or incorrect transactions. Additionally, mark prices sourced from multiple independent oracle providers mitigate the risk of price manipulation.
* Off-chain Trading Infrastructure: Off-chain order matching and risk engines, combined with a unique settlement architecture, deliver remarkable performance in terms of throughput, end-to-end latency, and trade settlement. This performance is comparable to centralized exchanges and superior to other hybrid exchanges or decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

### **Rationale for Using Starknet as a Settlement Layer**

When selecting the optimal settlement layer for Extended, we focused on four key criteria:

* **Security**: Starknet stands out as one of the most secure Layer 2 solutions. Recognized as a Stage 1 rollup, it meets critical decentralization and security requirements — as [highlighted by Vitalik Buterin](https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1923988377474330775).
* **Performance**: With [\~2 seconds transaction confirmation time](https://www.starknet.io/blog/bolt-version-upgrade/) and an [average cost user operation as low as $0.000057](https://www.starknet.io/blog/march-2025-roundup/), Starknet is currently among the most cost-efficient rollups on Ethereum — enabling high throughput at a low cost essential for processing tens of thousands of trades.
* **Longevity**: StarkWare, the inventors of STARKs and the team behind Starknet, has been building cryptographic infrastructure for over seven years. Through multiple market cycles, they’ve demonstrated technical resilience and strategic continuity.
* **Vision Alignment**: Starknet's ambition to become [the first Layer 2 to settle on both Bitcoin and Ethereum](https://www.starknet.io/blog/starknet-bitcoin-scaling/) aligns with Extended's roadmap to build a global unified margin. This will enable Extended to natively support BTC and its yield-bearing wrappers as collateral, marking a significant step toward broader capital efficiency and deeper liquidity.

# Team

We are an ex-Revolut team with hands-on experience in launching fintech products for millions of retail users. Our engineering team brings extensive experience in building high-performance trading infrastructure for both traditional finance and centralized crypto exchanges.

The founding team behind Extended includes:

* [@rf\_extended](https://x.com/rf_extended), CEO: Former Head of Crypto Operations at Revolut, ex-McKinsey.
* [@dk\_extended](https://x.com/dk_extended), CTO: Architect of 4 crypto exchanges, including recently launched Revolut Crypto Exchange.
* [@spooky\_x10](https://twitter.com/spooky_x10), CBO: Former Lead Engineer at Revolut Crypto and one of the major contributors behind Corda blockchain.

Our journey as a team began at Revolut, where we saw millions of retail users enter crypto during the last bull run, but also noticed a lack of high-quality products beyond the top exchanges and an overall suboptimal DeFi experience. The collapse of FTX made it clear that change was needed.

We founded Extended driven by the ambition to match centralized exchanges in latency, throughput, and features — while staying true to the principles of self-custody and transparency. Starting with perpetuals, we plan to gradually expand our product offering to parallel leading CEXs and make DeFi trading more accessible and usable for everyday retail users.
# Trading Accounts and Margin

### Collateral

Extended supports USDC and [XVS (Extended Vault Shares)](https://docs.extended.exchange/extended-resources/vault) as collateral. Note that:

* USDC has a 100% contribution to Equity (1 USDC = 1 USD in Equity).
* XVS has a 75% contribution to Equity (1 USD worth of XVS = 0.75 USD in Equity).

### Margin Mode and Trading Accounts

By default, our platform enables cross-margin, allowing collateral to be shared among all positions within a single trading account. Alternatively, users can opt for isolated margin by creating separate trading accounts under the same wallet.&#x20;

Users can create up to 10 trading accounts with independent margin per single wallet. The liquidation of one trading account does not impact the liquidation of other trading accounts created under the same wallet.&#x20;

Users have the ability to transfer their Available Balance for Withdrawals (defined below) between trading accounts without any fees. However, it's important to note that these transfers can impact the margin ratio and the liquidation of the involved individual accounts.

For detailed information on the liquidation process, please refer to the [Liquidation Logic](https://docs.extended.exchange/extended-resources/trading/liquidation-logic) section.

### Account Balances

Every trading account has the following balances:

**Equity = Wallet Balance + Unrealised PnL**, where:

* Wallet Balance = Deposits - Withdrawals + Realised PnL.
* Unrealised PnL = Position Size \* (Mark Price - Entry Price).

**Available Balance for Trading = Equity - Initial Margin Requirement**, where:

* Initial Margin Requirement for a given market = Max(Abs(Position Value + Value of Buy Orders), Abs(Position Value + Value of Sell Orders))\*1 / Leverage.
* The Initial Margin for Conditional Orders is not deducted from the Available Balance for Trading until the Trigger Price is reached, and the order is placed in the Order Book.
* If the Available Balance for Trading becomes less than 0, all open orders except for reduce-only orders are canceled. Additionally, as long as the Available Balance is less than 0, the user can only place orders that reduce the size of existing positions.

**Available Balance for Withdrawals = Wallet Balance + min(0,Unrealised PnL) - Initial Margin Requirement**

### Hedge Mode

Currently, our platform does not support hedge mode, which would allow users to simultaneously open long and short positions in the same market. However, users can create sub-accounts to emulate this behavior.

### Self-Trade Prevention

Self-Trade Prevention, which blocks the matching of two opposing orders from the same trading account, is enabled by default, resulting in the cancellation of the resting order.
# Trading Rules

The trading rules provided below include various limitations that apply to markets listed on the exchange. Users can also access specific trading rules for each market through the 'Trading Rules' tab on the main trading screen.

All crypto markets on Extended are categorized into 6 Market Groups based on the liquidity of different markets, and Extended has both market-specific and group-specific trading rules.

### Market-Specific Trading Rules

Market-specific trading rules include:

* Minimum Trade Size: Users cannot place orders below the minimum trade size.&#x20;
* Minimum Change in Trade Size: Users cannot modify orders by an amount lower than minimum change in trade size.&#x20;
* Minimum Price Change: Prices on the exchange cannot change by an amount below minimum price change.

# Margin Schedule

### Initial Margin

Initial Margin is the required deposit to place an order and open a position. It's calculated as 1 divided by the leverage.&#x20;

Leverage can range from 1 to the maximum leverage, which depends on the market and the value of open position and open orders in that market. Leverage may vary across different markets, but within a specific market, a single leverage rate is applied to both the open position and all open orders.

When a user modifies the leverage, this change is applied to both the open position and all open orders in that market. However, the change can fail if the total value of the open position and open orders exceeds the maximum allowed for the selected leverage, or if the initial margin requirement, recalculated with the new leverage, is not satisfied.

### Maintenance Margin

Maintenance Margin is the minimum amount of margin required to maintain a position after it has been opened. Positions are subject to liquidation when the account equity falls below the maintenance margin requirement.

Maintenance margin equals 50% of the initial margin at maximum leverage allowed for a given market and position value.

### Order Validation against Margin Schedule

When placing a new order, it must ensure that the position remains below the maximum position value for the selected leverage:

* If the new order increases the absolute sum of the position value, the new order value, and the value of any triggered orders in the same direction as the new order, then the following criteria should be met;$$Abs(Sum(Position Value, New Order Value, Value of Triggered Orders))≤Max Position Value For Given Leverage$$
* If the new order does not increase the absolute sum of the position value, the new order value, and the value of any triggered orders in the same direction as the new order, then the validation is auto-passed.

### Margin Schedule

The Margin Schedule varies across 6 Market Groups. Value brackets may be adjusted over time, depending on available liquidity or changes in asset price.

# Order Cost

### Order Placement

When a user places a new order, we check that the Available Balance for Trading is greater than or equal to the Order Cost, where:

* Available Balance for Trading = Equity - Initial Margin for Open Positions and Orders
* Order Cost for Buy Orders = max(Initial Margin Rate \* New Order Price \* (New Order Size + min(0, 2 \* (Open Position Size + Triggered Buy Order Size 1+ … + Triggered Buy Order Size N))) - Open Loss, 0)
* Order Cost for Sell Orders = max(-Initial Margin Rate \* New Order Price \* (New Order Size + max(0, 2 \* (Open Position Size + Triggered Sell Order Size 1+ … + Triggered Sell Order Size N))) - Open Loss, 0)

In the equations above:

* Open Loss =  min(New Order Size \* (Mark Price - New Order Price), 0)
* Position / Order Size is positive for Long and Negative for Short

### Orders Cancellation

If the Available Balance for Trading becomes less than 0, all open orders except for reduce-only orders are canceled. Additionally, as long as the Available Balance is less than 0, the user can only place orders that reduce the size of existing positions.
# Order Types

<table><thead><tr><th width="192">Order Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Market Order</td><td>Executes immediately at the prevailing market price.</td></tr><tr><td>Limit Order</td><td>Executes at the chosen limit price or better.</td></tr><tr><td><a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-1">Conditional Order </a></td><td>Activates a Market or Limit order when the specified trigger price is reached. On Extended, trigger prices can be linked to Mark, Index, or Last Prices.</td></tr><tr><td>TWAP Order</td><td>Executes market orders over a specified period at defined frequency, aiming to minimize price impact by distributing the total order into smaller sub-orders. Users can opt to "randomize" these sub-orders, in which case each sub-order's size is automatically adjusted within ±20% of the original trade size.</td></tr><tr><td>Scaled Order</td><td>Places multiple limit orders across a defined price range, distributing the total order size into smaller sub-orders to manage execution impact and achieve a desired average entry or exit price. Users can opt to apply a size skew between 0.01 and 100.00, which adjusts the distribution of sub-order sizes according to a geometric progression.​</td></tr></tbody></table>

However, all open non-reduce-only limit orders in the same direction will be canceled as a result.</td></tr><tr><td>Post Only</td><td>An order can only be added to the order book but not executed immediately.</td></tr><tr><td>Take Profit / Stop Loss (TPSL)</td><td><p>An order triggered when the market reaches the specified Take Profit or Stop Loss price.<br><br>Extended supports following types of TPSL orders:</p><ol><li>Position TPSL: This applies to the full size of the position. If the TPSL for the full position size is triggered, the entire position is closed. Position TPSL can be added when placing a new order or from the Positions Tab.</li><li>Partial Position TPSL: The size of a single partial position TPSL can be anywhere up to the current open position size. Partial Position TPSL can only be added from the Positions Tab.</li><li>Order TPSL: This applies to the specific order, with the size of the TPSL order being equal to the size of the original order.

# Liquidation Logic

### **Liquidation Criteria**

When a trading account's equity falls below the maintenance margin requirement, or when the Margin Ratio exceeds 100%, the account becomes subject to liquidation. The Margin Ratio is calculated as the sum of Maintenance Margin Requirements for all open positions divided by the Equity, multiplied by 100%, where:

* Maintenance Margin Requirement for a single position = Abs (Position Size \* Mark Price) \* Maintenance Margin Rate
* Equity = Wallet Balance + Unrealised PnL

Before liquidation occurs, Extended issues two margin calls: the first when the Margin Ratio exceeds 66%, and the second when it exceeds 80%. Margin calls don't impose any restrictions on the account but rather serve as reminders that the account is at risk of liquidation. To avoid liquidation, users should either top up their balance or reduce their positions.

### Liquidation Process

To safeguard users’ margin and minimize potential losses, Extended employs a partial liquidation process designed to avoid fully closing users’ positions whenever possible:

1. The liquidation process begins with a partial liquidation of the user’s XVS balance.\
   (Refer to the details of XVS liquidation [here](https://docs.extended.exchange/extended-resources/vault).)
2. If the account remains in liquidation after the XVS balance has been fully converted to USDC, the system identifies the perpetual position with the largest unrealised loss.
3. Gradually liquidate this position using a maximum of five Fill or Kill orders, each comprising 20% of the position's original size (with a minimum order value of $1,000), executed at the position's Bankruptcy Price.&#x20;
4. If any of the partial liquidation orders fail, execute a single Fill or Kill order for the entire position size at a price 5% worse than the position's Bankruptcy Price.
5. If, after liquidating the position with the largest Unrealised Loss, the account's Margin Ratio remains above 100%, proceed with the partial liquidation of the position with the second-largest Unrealised Loss.&#x20;
6. The liquidation process ceases once the account's Margin Ratio becomes ≤ 100%.

If a position is liquidated at a price better than the position's bankruptcy price, a 1% Liquidation Fee is earned by the insurance fund. However, if the position is liquidated at a price worse than the bankruptcy price, the insurance fund absorbs the losses.

In cases where the position cannot be liquidated at a price 5% worse than the bankruptcy price, or if the insurance fund is unable to cover the losses, the Auto Deleveraging (ADL) process is triggered.

### Insurance Fund

The Extended Vault serves as an insurance fund covering all pairs, but access to it — and the maximum absorbable loss per trade — depends on the specific market.

<table><thead><tr><th width="103">Group*</th><th>Access to % of the Fund in given 24H</th><th>Max Loss by the Fund per Trade</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>15%</td><td>$100 k</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>15%</td><td>$50 k</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>15%</td><td>$50 k</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>10%</td><td>$25 k</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5%</td><td>$15 k</td></tr><tr><td>EUR, XAU</td><td>15%</td><td>$50 k</td></tr><tr><td>SPX, NDX</td><td>10%</td><td>$25 k</td></tr></tbody></table>

*\*Refer to the section* [*Margin Schedule* ](https://docs.extended.exchange/extended-resources/trading/margin-schedule)*for grouping of crypto markets.*

Remaining Insurance Fund Limit for a given market = Daily Insurance Fund Limit - Insurance Fund Loss on a given market during this day.

Besides market-level usage limits, the insurance fund is also subject to a global constraint: it cannot be depleted by more than 15% in a single day.

Daily Insurance Fund Limits are updates once a day at 00:00 UTC.

### Auto Deleveraging (ADL)

If the account equity falls below zero and the position cannot be liquidated through the insurance fund, the Auto Deleveraging (ADL) process is initiated. During ADL, the liquidated position is closed against the most profitable trader with the highest leverage, as determined by the ADL ranking at the Bankruptcy Price of the Liquidated Position.

The ADL ranking is computed separately for long and short positions as follows:

For Profitable Position: ADL Ranking = PNL Percentage \* Position Margin Ratio,

For Loss Making Position: ADL Ranking = PNL Percentage / Position Margin Ratio, where:

* PNL percentage = Unrealised Position PnL / Abs(Position Size \* Entry Price),
* Position Margin Ratio = Abs (Position Size \* Mark Price) \* Maintenance Margin Rate / Max(Equity,1).

If a profitable user is selected for ADL in, their open orders in that market are canceled, while open orders for other markets remain unaffected. Trading and liquidation fees are not charged in ADL.

### Liquidation and Bankruptcy Prices

The Liquidation Price is the position's Mark price at which the account Margin Ratio exceeds 100%, indicating that the liquidation process should begin. It's important to note that the Liquidation Price serves as a reference number, and actual liquidation occurs only when the Margin Ratio exceeds 100%.

Liquidation Price of Position A = (Maintenance Margin of Other Positions - Wallet Balance - Unrealised PnL of Other Positions + Position A Size \* Position A Entry Price) / Position A Size, where:

* Wallet Balance = Deposits - Withdrawals + Realised PnL,
* Unrealised PnL of a Single Position = Position Size \* (Mark Price - Entry Price),
* Position Size is positive for Long Positions and negative for Short Positions.

The Bankruptcy Price is the price at which liquidation orders are submitted, and the Auto Deleveraging (ADL) is performed. Bankruptcy Price represents the position's price at which the account Margin Ratio, in the event of position liquidation at this price, remains unchanged.

Bankruptcy Price of Position A = (Maintenance Margin of Other Positions / Margin Ratio - Wallet Balance - Unrealised PnL of Other Positions + Position A Size \* Position A Entry Price) / Position A Size
# Funding Payments

### Overview

Funding payments are recurring fees exchanged between counterparties of the perpetual contract (from long positions to short positions and vice versa), ensuring the perpetual's price remains aligned with the underlying spot price of the asset. In practice:

* If the perpetual price exceeds the spot price, long positions pay funding fees to short positions.&#x20;
* If the perpetual price is lower than the spot price, short positions pay funding fees to long positions.

The size of the funding payment is determined by the difference between the perpetual and spot prices, as well as the duration over which this difference is realized.

### Funding Payments on Extended

At Extended, funding payments are charged every hour and are applied to all users with open positions at that time. If a user closes their position before the funding fee is charged, it is not applied.

**Funding Payment = Position Size \* Mark Price \* (-Funding Rate)**, which implies that:

* If the funding rate is positive, long positions pay to short positions.
* If the funding rate is negative, short positions pay to long positions.

**Funding Rate = (Average Premium + clamp(Interest Rate - Average Premium, 0.05%, -0.05%)) / 8**, which implies that:

* While funding payments are applied hourly, the funding rate realization period is 8 hours.
* The interest rate component is set at 0.01% per 8 hours for consistency with CEXs. It represents the difference between the cost of borrowing USD and the cost of borrowing the underlying crypto asset.
* The size of the hourly Funding Rate is capped as per the table below.

**Average Premium = (1\*Premium Index\_1 + ··· + N\*Premium Index\_N) / (1+···+N)**, where:

* Premium Index is calculated every 5 seconds and therefore 'N' is equal to 720.
* Premium Index = (Max(0, Impact Bid - Index Price) - Max(0, Index Price - Impact Ask)) / Index Price.
* Impact Bid / Ask refers to the average fill price to execute the Impact Notional on the Bid / Ask side.
* Impact Notional for different groups of markets is described below.

**Funding Rate Caps and Impact Notional Values across groups of markets.**

| Group\* | Rate Cap per hour | Impact Notional |
| ------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| 1       | 1%                | $10,000         |
| 2       | 2%                | $5,000          |
| 3       | 3%                | $2,500          |
| 4       | 3%                | $2,500          |
| 5       | 3%                | $2,500          |

*\*Refer to the section* [*Margin Schedule* ](https://docs.extended.exchange/extended-resources/trading/margin-schedule)*for grouping of markets.*
# Oracle Prices

### Overview

For crypto assets Extended relies on Mark and Index Prices obtained from 5 nodes of an independent Oracle Provider, [Stork](https://www.stork.network/):

* Mark Prices are used to determine the liquidability of accounts and calculate positions' unrealized PnL.
* Index Prices are used for the calculation of Funding Payments. For detailed information on the calculation of Funding Payments, please refer to the section on [Funding Payments](https://docs.extended.exchange/extended-resources/trading/funding-payments).

For a deeper understanding of the approach Stork employs to define Mark and Index Prices, explore Stork's comprehensive [documentation](https://docs.stork.network/).

Utilizing independent Oracle Providers like Stork helps prevent potential price manipulation and ensures an equitable and accurate reflection of asset values within the Extended ecosystem.

### Price Denomination

Both, Mark and Index Prices sourced from Stork are USD denominated. This means that on Extended USD PnL is settled in USDC given USDC margin.
# TradFi Markets

In addition to crypto markets, Extended currently offers perpetual contracts on the following traditional financial (TradFi) markets:

* EUR;
* SPX (S\&P 500);
* XAU (Gold);
* XBR (Brent Crude Oil).

**Trading Hours:** All TradFi markets are available for trading 24/7, including weekends and public holidays. However, please note that spreads on these markets may be significantly wider during these periods.​

**Fees:** Currently, TradFi markets have the same trading fees as crypto markets; however, this may be revised in the future.

**Pricing Data:** For index and mark prices on TradFi markets, Extended leverages [Pragma Oracle](https://www.pragma.build/).​

**Funding Payments:** The logic remains the same as in [crypto markets](https://docs.extended.exchange/extended-resources/trading/funding-payments), except that the Funding Rate is calculated as Average Premium / 8.

**Margin Requirements:** Each TradFi market has a custom margin schedule, detailed below.

# Account Creation

Extended is compatible with all EVM and Starknet wallets. When connecting a new wallet, we require two signatures for the following purposes:

* **Account Creation:** This involves generating your Extended account and signing key pair, which will be stored locally in your browser.
* **Registration:** This confirms your ownership of the Extended account and enables trading.

For each newly connected wallet, we automatically create one trading account. However, users have the option to create up to 10 trading accounts, each with independent margin, per single wallet.
# Deposits and Withdrawals

**EVM wallet users**

For EVM users, deposits and withdrawals are supported from the following chains:

* Ethereum
* Arbitrum
* Base
* BSC
* Avalanche
* Polygon

The table below shows the limits and processing times per individual transaction. There is no limit on the number of transactions a single user can submit. *Please note that actual limits and processing times may vary depending on liquidity availability on the Rhino.fi bridge.*

**Starknet wallet users**

Starknet wallet users can only deposit from and withdraw to Starknet. No limits apply.
# Vault

### Extended Vault Shares (XVS)

Whenever users deposit USDC into the vault, they receive Extended Vault Shares (XVS) in return. XVS:

* Contributes 75%\* of its value to both user Equity and Available Balance for Trading, allowing vault deposits to function as yield-bearing collateral for perpetual trading.\
  \* *Currently, XVS contributes 75% to Equity and 50% to Available Balance for Trading. During the week of December 15, the contribution to Available Balance for Trading will be increased to 75%.*
* Continuously accrues both base and extra yield, as described in detail below.

**Example: Impact of XVS Balance on User Equity and Available Balance for Trading**

| Scenario                                                          | User Equity | User Available Balance   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| The user has 1,000 USDC in the account                            | $1,000      | $1,000                   |
| The user deposits into the vault and receives $1,000 worth of XVS | $750        | $750                     |
| The user opens a $1,000 BTC long with 4x leverage                 | $750        | $500 ($750 - $1,000 / 4) |
| Unrealised PnL of BTC long becomes +$100                          | $850        | $600                     |

**Note:**

* If you use XVS as collateral, it may be affected by trading losses and liquidation. If you want your vault deposit to remain independent of trading activity, please keep XVS in a separate sub-account. At the moment of deposit, you can choose the target sub-account where the XVS balance will be credited.
* Currently, XVS balances can be transferred between sub-accounts but cannot be withdrawn from the exchange. We are considering enabling withdrawals in the future to support new DeFi primitives.

### Vault Deposits & Withdrawals

Deposit Logic:

* The minimum deposit is $5.&#x20;
* A 24-hour lockup period applies to each deposit. Withdrawals can only be made 24 hours after each deposit. If a user makes multiple deposits, each one follows its own lockup timeline.

Withdrawal Logic:

* No minimum withdrawal amount.
* Upon XVS withdrawal, the vault closes a pro-rata share of its open positions based on the user’s share of total vault equity and transfers the resulting USDC to the user’s account.
* Any price impact from closing positions is borne solely by the withdrawing user and is not shared with other vault participants.

### XVS yield

The Extended Vault quotes across all Extended markets, performs liquidations, and accrues exchange fees. These activities generate two types of yield:

* **Base Yield:** Earned by all users and generated through the vault’s trading and liquidation activity.
* **Extra Yield:** Earned based on user activity and derived from a share of exchange fees.

#### Base Yield

Base XVS yield is available to all vault depositors, with the logic of the yield-generating activities described below.

**Trading**

The vault actively quotes on all markets listed on Extended using an automated market-making strategy. Its quoting behavior is governed by both global and market-specific exposure controls, as well as dynamic capital allocation and spread management logic:

Exposure Management

* **Global Exposure Cap:**\
  If the vault’s leverage exceeds 0.2x, it will only quote in markets where it already holds exposure, and only on the side that reduces that exposure. This acts as a circuit breaker to prevent excessive leverage.
* **Per-Market Exposure Limits:**\
  Each market has a hard cap on allowable vault exposure. Less liquid assets have stricter limits to minimize risk from illiquidity.

Quoting Behavior

* **Adaptive Spread Quoting:**\
  Spreads are set dynamically—tightening in stable conditions and widening with volatility—to mitigate adverse selection. Quotes must remain within predefined width constraints to stay eligible for rewards.
* **Exposure-Aware Adjustments:**\
  The vault adjusts size and spread asymmetrically by side, reducing quoting size and widening the spread on the side that would further increase the vault's exposure.

Additionally, the vault accrues maker rebates from its market-making activity.

**Liquidations**

The vault handles all liquidations on the exchange, including liquidations of XVS balances and perpetual positions, and earns a 1% liquidation fee on healthy liquidations. It is important to note that, given the design of the XVS liquidation flow described below, the vault always earns a 1% fee on liquidations of XVS balances.&#x20;

Potential losses to the vault from liquidations of perpetual positions, when a position is closed below the bankruptcy price and the vault covers the shortfall, are limited by three controls:

* **Global Limit**:\
  The vault cannot be depleted by more than 15% in a single day for liquidation purposes.
* **Per-Market Daily Budget**:\
  Each market can only utilize a fraction of the vault’s balance within a 24-hour period. This limit varies by market, with less liquid assets having access to a smaller share of the vault.&#x20;
* **Per-Liquidation Loss Cap**:\
  Each market has a hard cap on the maximum absorbable loss per liquidation. Again, less liquid markets have more conservative caps.

If a liquidation breaches either of these limits, the position is automatically ADLed. You can check the market-specific loss caps [here](https://docs.extended.exchange/extended-resources/trading/liquidation-logic).

Given that the vault is designed to operate with low leverage (see Quoting Logic above), it is highly unlikely to become a counterparty to ADL. Therefore, the vault is not intended to serve as a last-resort backstop for failed liquidations.

#### Extra Yield *(to be launched on the week of December 15)*

Extra XVS Yield depends on user activity as per the logic below:

* All users starting from the Knight trading league earn extra yield on their XVS balance.
* The higher the user’s trading league, the higher the extra yield. The increase in extra yield accelerates from lower to higher leagues.
* There is currently a $300k per-client vault deposit cap on which extra yield is paid across all leagues.

Unlike Base yield, Extra yield is paid in XVS once per day (meaning the user’s XVS balance will increase daily), and the additional XVS is accrued into the user’s main account. Extra yield is funded from a share of the fees generated by the exchange. In the longer run, extra yield will also accrue a share of the interest income generated by the integrated lending market.

#### Mechanics of the XVS Liquidation Process

Given that XVS represents a claim on vault equity, which includes open positions, the liquidation process for XVS differs from regular liquidations. The logic works as follows:

* When a user with an XVS balance becomes subject to liquidation, their XVS balance is liquidated first, meaning it is withdrawn from the vault with a 1% liquidation fee that is accrued to the vault.
* When liquidating vault shares, the vault closes its open positions in proportion to the liquidated XVS.
* If the vault cannot close its positions via the order book (for example, due to insufficient liquidity), a special operation called Force Close is used.
  * The vault closes positions against the most profitable and highly leveraged user on the opposite side (as determined by the [ADL ranking](https://docs.extended.exchange/trading/liquidation-logic#auto-deleveraging-adl)) at the Mark Price.
  * Force Close is similar to ADL, but unlike ADL, where positions are closed at the bankruptcy price, Force Close operates at Mark Price and does not impose direct losses on the opposing user.
  * Given the vault’s risk limits (the maximum position it can take in any market), Force Close is expected to be used only in extreme scenarios.
* Because of this design, the XVS balance of a liquidated user can always be withdrawn from the vault.
* After the XVS balance is withdrawn, if the user remains unhealthy, the system proceeds with the regular liquidation process for the user’s remaining perpetual positions.
# Referrals and Affiliates

### Referrals program

To participate in the referral program, you must achieve $10,000 in traded volume.

Once you meet this requirement, you can create a unique referral link on `app.extended.exchange/referrals` by appending your personal code to the base URL (e.g., `app.extended.exchange/join/CODE`). The CODE can include any combination of Latin letters and numbers, up to 15 characters long. A single user can create multiple referral links.

Referrers earn **points plus** **10% of the net fees** generated by their referrals, with:

* no cap on trading volume per referral;
* net fees = fees paid − maker rebates for the corresponding trades.

Invited users receive a 10% discount on commissions for their first $50M in total trading volume.

### Affiliates and sub-affilates program

You can only join if you receive a direct invite from the Extended team or a referral from an existing Extended affiliate.

Affiliates earn **boosted points and rebates on all net fees** generated by their referrals, with:

* no cap on trading volume per referral.
* net fees = fees paid − maker rebates for the corresponding trades.

The affiliates program is designed to automatically redistribute **half** of the affiliates’ earned referral points back to their users, providing unique benefits for users who joined via an affiliate link. Even after this redistribution, affiliates still net more points than regular referrers.

Affiliates can also refer eligible users to become their **sub-affiliates** and earn **10% of the fees paid** by the sub-affiliates’ users. This 10% is paid in addition to the sub-affiliates’ own rebates and does not reduce their earnings.
# Builder Codes

### Implementation Logic

Builder codes enable developers who build alternative frontends for Extended to earn a builder fee on each trade they route for users. This fee goes 100% to the builder and is defined per-order. To enable builder codes, a builder must have an Extended account.

When a builder routes an order through their app or strategy, they include their `clientId` (available on the API page in the Extended UI) and a `builderFee` value:

```
builderId: 123,     // builder's clientId
builderFee: 0.0005  // fee fraction (0.0005 = 0.05%)
```

The maximum allowed builder fee can be fetched using the `get_fees` method — the `TradingFeeModel` includes the `builder_fee_rate` parameter.

There is no manual builder-fee claiming process. All builder fees are automatically transferred to the builder’s Extended account daily at 00:00 UTC.

You can find an example implementation in our Builder Order Example Code: [link](https://github.com/x10xchange/python_sdk/blob/starknet/examples/04_create_limit_order_with_builder.py).

If a user qualifies for a trading rebate while using a builder code, they still receive that rebate. The builder-codes system fully supports Extended’s fee and rebate schedules.

### Referrals & Builder Codes

If a user registers with a referral code, that code remains permanently linked to their account.

However, when the same user trades through a builder code, the builder code overrides the referral code for trades that include a builder fee. In those trades, the original referrer receives no commission, and only the builder receives the builder fee.

If the user trades directly via the Extended interface (that is, without a builder code), referral rewards and discounts still apply.

Referral-fee discounts apply only to non-builder orders. Trades routed through builder codes are not eligible for referral-based discounts.
# Points

Season 1 of the Points Program was launched on April 29, 2025, with up to 1.2M points available for weekly distributions, which take place every Tuesday at 00:00 UTC.

Users can earn points across three categories:

* **Trading** – Earn points through organic trading activity.
* **Providing Liquidity** – Deposit funds into the vault or provide tight liquidity in relevant markets.
* **Referring** – Earn a share of the points generated by your referrals. Affiliates earn more.

The team reserves the right to update the allocation criteria and logic, including the addition of new factors, which can be revised on a weekly basis.

Ahead of Season 1 we distributed 4.3M Early Participation points on February 26 and April 28, 2025.

For all other details and updates on the Points Program, follow us on X and Discord.

# Leaderboard

The leaderboard displays three metrics for all traders within the selected time period:

1. Absolute PnL = Closing Account Equity - Opening Account Equity - Inbound transfers during the period (e.g., deposits) + Outbound transfer during the period (e.g., withdrawals);
2. PnL Percentage = Absolute PnL / max(100,Opening Account Equity + Sum of Inbound transfer in the period);
3. Total Trading Volume during the period.

Leaderboard is updated hourly.

Achieving top positions on the leaderboard does not automatically entitle traders to benefits or rewards. However, Extended occasionally organizes trading competitions that offer rewards to the top performers. To ensure you don't miss out on these opportunities, we encourage you to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/extendedapp) for the latest updates and information.
# Platform Outage

Extended operates around-the-clock trading platform, aiming to achieve 100% uptime and connectivity for our clients at all times.

However, there are instances when the platform may face interruptions, either from scheduled maintenance or unforeseen system problems.

To address any disruptions, we equip our clients with several tools designed to handle the various types of downtime.

### Advance Notifications

Most cases of downtime are related to planned maintenance. For such instances, we will take the following actions:

* Post a notification on Discord 24 hours before the maintenance begins, and repeat this notification 1 hour, and 10 minutes before maintenance starts.
* Activate a maintenance page on the UI during the maintenance period.

In case of unplanned maintenance, we will:

* Post a notification on Discord notifying users of the unexpected maintenance;
* Activate a maintenance page on the UI during the maintenance period.

### Deadman's switch

At times, you may encounter connectivity issues or network downtime, which prevents your application from making requests.&#x20;

To manage this, you can utilize the [Mass Auto-Cancel](https://x10xchange.github.io/x10-documentation/#scheduled-mass-cancel-dead-man-39-s-switch) endpoint. This feature allows you to set a timeout period; if no new requests are made before this period expires, all orders will automatically be cancelled.&#x20;

### Post-only period

Upon restart, the exchange will operate in post-only mode for 120 seconds. During this time, users can only:

* Cancel existing open orders;
* Submit post-only orders.

During the post-only period:

* Market orders and limit orders that would match against existing orders will be rejected;
* Conditional and take-profit/stop-loss (TPSL) orders will not trigger;
* Funding payments will not accrue;
* Liquidations will not be processed; however, if a position becomes eligible for liquidation after trading resumes, liquidation(s) will proceed as usual.
# Testnet

You can access our testnet at [starknet.sepolia.extended.exchange](https://starknet.sepolia.extended.exchange).

On the testnet, users can claim $1,000 worth of test USDC per day for each L1 wallet. Even if a user creates multiple trading accounts under a single L1 wallet, this $1,000 limit applies collectively to all associated trading accounts.

Claiming test collateral is the sole method for users to acquire deposits for trading on the testnet.

# Rationale & Vision

Originally built on StarkEx, Extended established itself as a fast and efficient platform for perpetual trading. As we expand our product suite beyond perps — into **unified margin with integrated lending markets and spot trading** — we need a more composable and scalable foundation. Starknet aligns perfectly with this vision — and below, we’ll explain why.

### What does this mean for users?

Existing Extended users will need to migrate from the current StarkEx instance to the new Starknet instance. The migration process has been designed to be as seamless as possible and is explained here. New users will be onboarded directly to the Starknet instance.

With the launch of the Starknet instance of the exchange, users will experience no disruption in their trading experience. Starknet will function purely as a settlement layer, with all chain-specific logic fully abstracted.

Extended will also support Starknet-native users. However, **EVM users won’t need to set up a Starknet wallet or interact with the network for deposits or withdrawals.** Near-instant deposits and withdrawals will be supported across six major EVM-compatible chains, with Solana integration coming soon.

### Why Starknet?

When selecting the optimal settlement layer for Extended, we focused on four key criteria:

1. **Security**\
   Starknet stands out as one of the most secure Layer 2 solutions. Recognized as a Stage 1 rollup, it meets critical decentralization and security requirements — as [highlighted by Vitalik Buterin](https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1923988377474330775).
2. **Performance**\
   With [\~2 seconds transaction confirmation time](https://www.starknet.io/blog/bolt-version-upgrade/) and an [average cost user operation as low as $0.000057](https://www.starknet.io/blog/march-2025-roundup/), Starknet is currently among the most cost-efficient rollups on Ethereum — enabling high throughput at a low cost essential for processing tens of thousands of trades.
3. **Longevity**\
   StarkWare, the inventors of STARKs and the team behind Starknet, has been building cryptographic infrastructure for over seven years. Through multiple market cycles, they’ve demonstrated technical resilience and strategic continuity.
4. **Vision Alignment**\
   Starknet’s ambition to become [the first Layer 2 to settle on both Bitcoin and Ethereum](https://www.starknet.io/blog/starknet-bitcoin-scaling/) aligns with Extended’s roadmap to build a global unified margin. This will enable Extended to natively support BTC and its yield-bearing wrappers as collateral, marking a significant step toward broader capital efficiency and deeper liquidity.

### What are we building at Extended?

Extended is building an open financial ecosystem powered by a global unified margin, enabling users to deploy their crypto assets in the most capital-efficient way.

The first phase of this roadmap focuses on **integrating a native lending and borrowing market into Extended**. This will allow users to post any supported asset — including yield-bearing ones — as collateral and earn additional yield through the integrated lending layer.

For example, if a user deposits wstETH as collateral and incurs a negative PnL while trading USDC-settled perpetuals, this effectively means borrowing USDC — with interest paid to USDC lenders.

Once the native lending market is in place, we’ll **add spot markets to Extended’s offering** — expanding toward a cross-asset collateral unified margin with integrated perpetuals, lending, and spot trading.

To support this architecture, we are migrating to Starknet, which will serve as the settlement layer — securing user balances and validating transactions. It is a foundational element that makes the Extended ecosystem trustless, with protocol logic verified by a decentralized and externally trusted network.

### What is our long-term ambition?

Unified margin will initially serve as a core internal product, designed to meet the needs of traders by enabling multi-asset collateral support and delivering one of the most capital-efficient trading systems in the market. However, the long-term vision for Extended goes far beyond that.

Following Hyperliquid’s success, many perpetual DEXs are now following the playbook of launching perps and then building a general-purpose chain — but Extended is taking a different path. We’ll be sharing more details soon, but briefly, the ambition is to build an **EVM-compatible network on top of Starknet, where unified margin logic is embedded directly into the base layer and exposed as an ERC-20 token accessible to all applications on the network**.

<figure><img src="https://3693216602-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FThTVaNuyiBCaumOB7kqP%2Fuploads%2FqHlyizdP9aXKq8yuQRiI%2F43293027-1e1e-4f53-8189-2bb75ab5a256.png?alt=media&#x26;token=0f74af17-69d4-4c8a-8e33-1f4eecc53dc0" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This means that core functions — such as margining with native, network-wide borrowing and lending, and liquidation — will be handled by the network itself rather than by individual applications.

The Extended network, with global unified margin at its core, will allow all applications within the network to access users’ available margin and share unified liquidity — reinforcing overall liquidity depth. From the user’s perspective, all activity will contribute to a single global margin account shared across applications, allowing them to manage one account instead of multiple app-specific ones and maximize capital efficiency by using the same margin across dApps.

### Roadmap

We’re following a three-step roadmap — **evolving from a Perp DEX into a full Open Financial Ecosystem powered by Native Unified Margin.** With the migration to Starknet, we're one step closer to completing Stage 1 and bringing to life our long-term vision — the Extended Ecosystem.

# Migration Guide

Please refer to [this article](https://docs.extended.exchange/starknet-migration/rationale-and-vision) to understand the rationale behind the move to Starknet and our longer-term vision for building the Extended ecosystem.

### Overarching Migration Logic

The migration will happen in three stages, outlined below. However, we encourage users to migrate as soon as possible, as **points will only accrue on the Starknet version of the exchange from the beginning of the migration process**. Additionally, we expect better liquidity on the Starknet instance.

Existing Extended users will need to migrate from the current StarkEx instance to the new Starknet instance, following the logic described below. With the launch of the Starknet instance, users will experience no disruption in their trading experience. Starknet will function purely as a settlement layer, with all chain-specific logic fully abstracted. This means:

* **EVM users will not need to set up a Starknet wallet or interact with the Starknet network for deposits or withdrawals.**
* Near-instant deposits and withdrawals will be supported across six major EVM-compatible chains, with Solana integration coming soon.

At any given time, only one version of the exchange will be available to each user — StarkEx before migrating, and Starknet after migrating. Once a user migrates to Starknet, they will no longer have access to the StarkEx version. However, **Points balances and complete trading history will be seamlessly transferred** to the Starknet instance.

After the migration begins, all new users will be onboarded directly to the Starknet instance.

### Migration Stages

#### Stage 1: Dual Operation Mode

* **Duration:** 2 weeks from the launch of the Starknet instance
* **Description:** During this stage, both StarkEx and Starknet instances will be fully operational for trading. Existing StarkEx users are encouraged to migrate at their convenience.
* **StarkEx Trading:** Fully operational
* **StarkEx Deposits & Withdrawals:** Fully operational
* **StarkEx Vault:**
  * New deposits are disabled
  * All vault positions are closed
  * No fee distributions
  * Vault stops processing liquidations — these will be handled by a separate insurance fund
* **Points:** Distributed exclusively on Starknet. Once a user completes the migration, all points accrued on the StarkEx instance will be automatically migrated to the Starknet instance of the exchange.
* **Fees:** 0 bps for reduce-only orders on StarkEx; otherwise, [regular trading fees](https://docs.extended.exchange/extended-resources/trading/trading-fees-and-rebates) apply on both StarkEx and Starknet.

#### Stage 2: StarkEx Wind-Down Mode

* **Duration:** 2 weeks after Stage 1
* **Description:** Users are strongly encouraged to complete their migration to Starknet during this period. The StarkEx instance begins winding down and limits trading activity.
* **StarkEx Trading:** Switched to reduce-only mode. Users can only decrease their exposure; opening new positions or increasing position sizes is disabled.
* **StarkEx Deposits & Withdrawals:**
  * Deposits: Disabled
  * Withdrawals: Both Fast and Slow withdrawals are fully operational
* **StarkEx Vault:**
  * New deposits are disabled
  * All vault positions are closed
  * No fee distributions
  * Vault stops processing liquidations — these will be handled by a separate insurance fund
* **Points:** Distributed exclusively on Starknet. Once a user completes the migration, all points accrued on the StarkEx instance will be automatically migrated to the Starknet instance of the exchange.
* **Fees:** 0 bps for reduce-only orders on StarkEx; otherwise, [regular trading fees](https://docs.extended.exchange/extended-resources/trading/trading-fees-and-rebates) apply on both StarkEx and Starknet.

#### Stage 3: StarkEx Freeze

* **Duration:** Begins after Stage 2 and continues until all users withdraw their funds.
* **Description:** All remaining positions on StarkEx will be force-closed at the latest Mark Price. The trading interface will no longer be available. Users will only be able to withdraw remaining funds through a dedicated withdrawal UI using the slow withdrawal mechanism. To access the Starknet instance of the exchange, users will first need to complete a slow withdrawal from StarkEx. Once the withdrawal is processed, they will be able to log in to Extended’s Starknet instance.
* **StarkEx Trading:** Disabled. All positions force-closed at Mark Price
* **StarkEx Deposits & Withdrawals:**
  * Deposits: Disabled
  * Withdrawals: Only slow withdrawals are supported through a dedicated withdrawal UI
* **StarkEx Vault:**
  * The vault is shut down
  * All user funds are returned to depositors
  * Users must withdraw these funds via slow withdrawals
* **Points:** Distributed exclusively on Starknet. To access points accrued on the StarkEx instance of the exchange, users must first complete a slow withdrawal from StarkEx. Once the withdrawal is processed, they will be able to log in to Extended’s Starknet instance and access their points balance.

### Migration Process: User Flow

Users will be guided through a dedicated migration page that handles all required steps. **The process includes:**

1. Close All Open Orders and Positions. Close all open orders and positions across all sub-accounts. We recommend closing positions with reduce-only orders on StarkEx, as these will not incur trading fees.
2. Consolidate Funds. Move funds from all sub-accounts into a single sub-account of your choice.&#x20;
3. Vault Funds. Funds held in the StarkEx vault do not require manual withdrawal. They will be migrated automatically.

Once all of the above steps are completed, go to the Migration page and click “Migrate.” The StarkEx interface will then transition to the Starknet UI with:

* **Your funds—including your Vault balance—typically arriving within 45 minutes**. In rare cases, it may take up to 6 hours. You’ll receive a notification once the transfer is complete.
* Points balances and complete trading history seamlessly transferred to the Starknet instance.

Existing StarkEx users with no funds or Vault balance on the exchange will be automatically migrated to Starknet at the start of Stage 1. No action is required.

⚠️ Please note: After migration, the StarkEx version of the exchange will no longer be accessible.

<figure><img src="https://3693216602-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FThTVaNuyiBCaumOB7kqP%2Fuploads%2FmzRoDpd8H87DCxj19h24%2FGroup%201900.png?alt=media&#x26;token=2ae057b0-99fc-4234-9205-189be67153c0" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Migration for Referrals and Affiliates

As soon as the migration starts, all referral commissions—whether from users who have migrated to Starknet or remain on StarkEx—will be accrued on Starknet. If an affiliate hasn’t migrated yet, they will still receive referral commissions on the Starknet instance and will be able to access them after completing the migration.

Starting with Stage 1, it will no longer be possible to create new referral links or activate referral codes on StarkEx. To create a new link, you’ll first need to migrate to Starknet. New users who join via your existing referral link will be onboarded to the Starknet version of the exchange.

⚠️ **Please note:** Starting from Stage 1, affiliates and their referrals on StarkEx will no longer earn Points for their activity. Points will only be accrued on Starknet.

### Migration for API Traders

The API endpoints on the Starknet instance of the exchange will remain the same as on StarkEx, but the signing scheme will change.

You can find an example of the new Starknet signing scheme [here](https://github.com/x10xchange/rust-crypto-lib-base/blob/main/src/lib.rs#L75), and we’ve also prepared a [Python SDK](https://github.com/x10xchange/python_sdk/tree/starknet) for the Starknet instance for your convenience.

In addition to the signing scheme change, there are a few other minor differences for API traders between Starknet and StarkEx, which are covered in our [API documentation](https://api.docs.extended.exchange/#starkex-to-starknet-migration).

We recommend implementing the new Starknet signing scheme as soon as possible to ensure a smooth migration. Our [testnet](https://starknet.sepolia.extended.exchange/perp) is already live on Starknet Sepolia, and you can test your integration there.&#x20;

If you have any questions, feel free to ask the team in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/extendedapp) #devs channel.

### Migration FAQ

#### How long will the migration of funds take?

Your funds — including your vault balance — will typically arrive within 45 minutes, though in rare cases, it may take up to 6 hours. You will receive a notification once the transfer is complete.

#### Will my points be migrated?

Yes, all of your accrued points will be migrated to the Starknet instance of the exchange.

**Will I need to pay fees to close my positions on StarkEx?**

At the start of the migration, fees for reduce-only orders on StarkEx will be waived. We recommend closing positions using reduce-only orders, as these will not incur trading fees.

#### Will I be able to see my past trading history after migration?

Yes, complete trading history will be seamlessly transferred to the Starknet instance.

#### Do I need to migrate if I only have funds in the vault?

Yes, you will need to manually confirm the migration. However, funds held in the Vault do not require manual withdrawal—they will be migrated automatically once you confirm.

**Do I need to migrate if I don't have any funds on the exchange?**

No—existing StarkEx users with no funds or Vault balance will be automatically migrated to Starknet at the start of Stage 1. No action is required.

# Margin Schedule

### Initial Margin

Initial Margin is the required deposit to place an order and open a position. It's calculated as 1 divided by the leverage.&#x20;

Leverage can range from 1 to the maximum leverage, which depends on the market and the value of open position and open orders in that market. Leverage may vary across different markets, but within a specific market, a single leverage rate is applied to both the open position and all open orders.

When a user modifies the leverage, this change is applied to both the open position and all open orders in that market. However, the change can fail if the total value of the open position and open orders exceeds the maximum allowed for the selected leverage, or if the initial margin requirement, recalculated with the new leverage, is not satisfied.

The Initial Margin requirement is checked both when placing an order and when executing it.

### Maintenance Margin

Maintenance Margin is the minimum amount of margin required to maintain a position after it has been opened. Positions are subject to liquidation when the account equity falls below the maintenance margin requirement.

Maintenance margin equals 50% of the initial margin at maximum leverage allowed for a given market and position value.

### Order Validation against Margin Schedule

When placing a new order, it must ensure that the position remains below the maximum position value for the selected leverage:

* If the new order increases the absolute sum of the position value, the new order value, and the value of any triggered orders in the same direction as the new order, then the following criteria should be met;$$Abs(Sum(Position Value, New Order Value, Value of Triggered Orders))≤Max Position Value For Given Leverage$$
* If the new order does not increase the absolute sum of the position value, the new order value, and the value of any triggered orders in the same direction as the new order, then the validation is auto-passed

### Margin Schedule

The Margin Schedule varies across 5 Market Groups. Value brackets may be adjusted over time, depending on available liquidity or changes in asset price.
